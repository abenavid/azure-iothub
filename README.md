A role to create IoT Hub in Azure

Azure IoT Hub is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft that allows for easy management of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and their data. It provides a secure and scalable platform for connecting, monitoring, and managing IoT devices and their data, allowing for real-time insights and actions.

Azure IoT Hub supports a variety of communication protocols, including HTTPS, MQTT, and AMQP, and can integrate with a range of devices and platforms, such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other IoT devices. It also provides features for device provisioning, device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging, device management, and security.

With Azure IoT Hub, users can connect and manage millions of devices, monitor device health and performance, and analyze data from IoT devices to gain valuable insights and take appropriate actions. It can also integrate with other Azure services, such as Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Functions, to enable real-time processing and automated actions based on IoT data.

Overall, Azure IoT Hub simplifies IoT device management, enhances security, and enables efficient data processing and analysis, making it an integral part of any IoT solution.
